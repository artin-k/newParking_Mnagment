This is a university project for managing a public parking lot.
So far, the registration and login pages have been completed, and the user information is hashed for greater security and stored in the database.
The administration page and the home page are also in their initial state.
It also informs the user with a series of messages whether the registration was correct or not, and also shows the status of the user's login page.
